## MT65xx unpack and repack scripts

If you are looking for a way to easily unpack / repack boot.img, recovery.img or logo.bin from your MediaTek device, don't look any further. Here you can find my own Perl scripts.

Scripts were first based on the ones available on [Android-DLS WiKi](http://android-dls.com/wiki/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Unpack%2C_Edit%2C_and_Re-Pack_Boot_Images), but are now highly modified in order to work with specific MTK boot and recovery images. Currently, the scripts fully work with any MT6516, MT6513 or MT6573 images. It is also confirmed to be working with new MT6575 (and even MT6577) images.
